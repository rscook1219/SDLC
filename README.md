How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

- When interpreting user needs, I begin with effective communication and observation. When listening to the user's needs is the first step in creating a solution that addresses their requirements. Creating "user stories" helps with the process by simplifying complex requirements into understandable and actionable tasks. This helps us develop features that meet the user's needs and expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- My approach when developing programs is iterative and based on Agile methodologies. I like to prioritize modularity, clean code, and frequent testing. This helps allow the team and I to make any changes or improvements continuously rather than after the project is done. I plan to integrate more automated testing and continuous deployment/continuous integration into the Agile workflow to create a more streamlined and efficient development cycle.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- Being a good team member in software development is more than just writing good code. We need to collaborate and work together effectively. We need to respect each other and contribute to code reviews. It also means taking ownership of failures and not just successes. Communication is the biggest key. We need to keep the entire team updated on any changes or difficulties. This helps to align the team’s objectives and helps to deliver a successful project.
